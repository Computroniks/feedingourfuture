We are a group of young people aged between 16 and 17 from the North
West of England currently partaking in the NCS program. As part of the
program, we are developing our own social action project. For our social
action project, we looked at the issues that affected the communities
that we live in as well as the wider country. We found that one of the
biggest issues that affects many in the North West is food insecurity
and food poverty.

Having chosen food insecurity as our issue, we looked into local and
national charities that help those suffering from food insecurity. We
got into contact with the Olive Branch, a local charity working in
Lancaster and the surrounding areas.

Our main aim for our social action project is to raise awareness for the
Olive Branch, both among supporters and those who may need their
support. We also aim to raise money for the charity as well as collect
donations of food, especially those foods that the food bank consistently
runs short of.

To achieve our aim, we have designed posters and flyers to hand out
around Lancaster to help raise awareness. We also have an online social
media presence on Instagram
([@ncs_lancaster](https://instagram.com/ncs_lancaster)) to help us reach
a wider audience.
