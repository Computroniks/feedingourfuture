Many of you have likely already heard of The Olive Branch – it’s the
charity that we had to buy tinned food for during the harvest festival.
If you haven’t heard of them, they’re an amazing local charity that
provides food parcels for those who are struggling with food insecurity
(check out our other blog post for more info on that) and work to reduce
food waste by partnering with businesses to take food that would have
been thrown out and putting it in these food parcels. 

However, this is not the only service that The Olive Branch provides.
They have a mission to hep with the underlying problems that cause food
insecurity, which means they connect with their guests personally and
give referrals to other charities or services that can help with
problems such as addiction and homelessness. They do this by sitting
down and talking to each of their guests, and giving them tailored
advice regarding their situation, and even offer you a nice cuppa while
they’re at it. What’s even better is that, while a referral is needed to
be able to obtain food parcels, any other service by The Olive Branch is
available to anyone, you can just walk in!

As a Christian charity, The Olive Branch believes that everybody is made
by God, and that he loves everyone. While the idea of going to a
Christian charity may be unsettling for some, this philosophy means that
they willingly accept people from all walks of life, and do not
discriminate or push you towards a faith. 

For those who are reading this blog because they want to help others, on
the other hand, here are some tips straight from The Olive Branch for
things you can donate which is often left out (some of it isn’t even
food). 

* Coffee and tea
* Cooking oil
* Jam
* Toiletries
* Multipack biscuits & cake
* Baby supplies

Overall, I hope this post has given you an oversight as to what The
Olive Branch is all about, what they aim to do, how you can help, and
how they can help you. Consider donating what you can, whether it be
food, money, or non-food items. Everything is appreciated.
